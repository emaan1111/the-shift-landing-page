# ðŸ”§ Quick Fix Summary

## The Problem You Had
âœ‹ Registrations were showing **twice** on the registrations page and being counted twice in analytics

## Root Cause
1. Form submissions were saved to **two places** (GitHub + local backup) with slightly different timestamps
2. Server deduplication was too strict - it checked exact timestamps (failed when 1ms apart)
3. No protection against accidental double-clicks

## The Fix (What I Did)

### 1. **Smart Deduplication in Server** 
Changed from: `(email, exact_timestamp)` matching
Changed to: `(email, full_name, date_only)` matching

**Result**: Registrations saved at slightly different times are now recognized as duplicates

### 2. **Double-Click Protection in Form**
Added: Blocks same email from registering twice within 3 seconds

**Result**: Users can't accidentally register twice by double-clicking

## What to Do Now

1. **Test it** - Try registering and double-clicking the button - should only create 1 registration âœ“
2. **Existing duplicates are automatically cleaned** - Next time registrations page loads, duplicates vanish
3. **Analytics will be correct** - "Unique Emails" count will match reality

## Files Changed
- âœ… `server.py` - Better deduplication logic
- âœ… `index.html` - Double-click protection
- ðŸ“„ `DUPLICATE_REGISTRATIONS_ANALYSIS.md` - Full technical analysis
- ðŸ“„ `DUPLICATE_REGISTRATIONS_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Complete details

## No Action Needed From You
The fix is automatic. Registrations will show correctly on the registrations page immediately.
