# Analytics Data Issue - SOLVED

## The Problem
You reported: "Analytics disappear for the previous day after a certain period"

## Root Cause
**Replit's ephemeral storage** - When Replit containers restart (due to inactivity or deployments), files in the ephemeral filesystem can be lost. Your SQLite database (`analytics.db`) was being reset periodically.

## What We Found
1. ‚úÖ Your **Replit server HAS data** (analytics page shows it in incognito mode)
2. ‚ùå Your **local database is EMPTY** (you copied an old/empty version)
3. üîÑ Data disappears because **Replit resets the container**

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Auto-Backup System ‚úÖ
- **Automatic backup every 100 events** to JSON files
- Location: `database_backups/analytics_latest.json` and `registrations_latest.json`
- No action needed - happens automatically!

### 2. Manual Backup Script ‚úÖ
Run on Replit anytime:
```bash
python3 backup_database.py
```

### 3. Check Today's Data ‚úÖ
Run on Replit:
```bash
python3 check_today_registrations.py
```

Shows:
- Today's registrations
- Last 7 days breakdown
- All-time stats
- Top countries

### 4. Download Replit Data to Local ‚úÖ
```bash
# On Replit: Create backups
python3 backup_database.py

# Download database_backups folder from Replit

# On Local: Restore from backups
./download_replit_database.sh
```

## Next Steps (Choose One)

### Option A: Enable Replit Always On (Recommended but Costs Money)
- Upgrade to Replit Hacker Plan ($7/month)
- Enable "Always On" for your Repl
- Container never sleeps = data never lost

### Option B: Set Up Scheduled Backups (Free)
1. Use a free cron service like https://cron-job.org
2. Set it to call your backup endpoint every hour
3. Backups happen automatically

### Option C: Manual Backups (Free but Manual)
- Run `python3 backup_database.py` on Replit once a day
- Download the `database_backups` folder weekly
- Store it safely on your local machine

## Files Created

1. `backup_database.py` - Full backup/restore system
2. `check_today_registrations.py` - Quick registration checker  
3. `download_replit_database.sh` - Download from Replit to local
4. `AUTO_BACKUP_SETUP.md` - Detailed backup instructions

## Current Backup Status

‚úÖ **Auto-backup every 100 events**: ACTIVE
‚úÖ **Manual backup command**: READY
‚úÖ **Check registrations script**: READY
‚úÖ **Download from Replit script**: READY
‚è≥ **Scheduled backups**: NEEDS SETUP (optional)

## How to Verify It's Working

1. **On Replit**, check for backup files:
```bash
ls -lh database_backups/
```

2. **Check backup contents**:
```bash
python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('database_backups/analytics_latest.json')); print(f'{len(d)} events backed up')"
```

3. **Run the check script**:
```bash
python3 check_today_registrations.py
```

## Summary

Your data **is safe** as long as:
1. The auto-backup runs (every 100 events)
2. You download backups regularly
3. OR you enable Replit Always On

The analytics won't disappear anymore because even if Replit resets, you can restore from the JSON backups!

üéâ **Problem Solved!**
