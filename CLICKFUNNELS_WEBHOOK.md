# ClickFunnels 2.0 Webhook Integration

## Option: Use ClickFunnels Form Submission Webhook

Instead of using the REST API (which has CORS issues), ClickFunnels 2.0 might provide a webhook URL for form submissions.

## Steps to Get Your ClickFunnels Webhook URL:

### Method 1: Through ClickFunnels Form
1. Go to ClickFunnels 2.0
2. Create a new Funnel or Page
3. Add a Form element
4. In the form settings, look for "Webhook" or "Form Submission URL"
5. Copy that URL

### Method 2: Through Integrations
1. Go to ClickFunnels 2.0 → Settings → Integrations
2. Look for "Webhooks" or "Custom Webhooks"
3. Create a new webhook for "Form Submission"
4. Copy the webhook URL

### Method 3: Through Contact API (If Available)
Some ClickFunnels accounts have a special form submission endpoint:
- Format: `https://WORKSPACE.myclickfunnels.com/forms/submit`
- Or: `https://api.myclickfunnels.com/webhooks/forms/FORM_ID`

## What I Need From You:

Please check your ClickFunnels 2.0 dashboard and find:
1. **Webhook URL** for form submissions (if available)
2. **OR** let me know if you want to use ClickFunnels' native form embed instead

## Alternative: ClickFunnels Native Form

If webhooks aren't available, we can:
1. Create a form directly in ClickFunnels 2.0
2. Get the embed code
3. Replace your current form with the ClickFunnels form
4. Style it to match your landing page

This way, the form submits directly to ClickFunnels (no CORS issues).
