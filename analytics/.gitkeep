# Analytics Data Storage

This folder stores visitor analytics data in JSON format.

Each day's data is stored in a separate file named `visits-YYYY-MM-DD.json`.

The data is automatically created by the tracker script when visitors come to your website.

**Note:** This folder needs to exist in your GitHub repository for the tracker to work.
