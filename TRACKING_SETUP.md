# GitHub-Based Visitor Tracker Setup Guide

## What You're Getting

‚úÖ Visitor data stored in your GitHub repository as JSON files  
‚úÖ Beautiful analytics dashboard page at `/analytics.html`  
‚úÖ Tracks page visits, button clicks, referrers, and more  
‚úÖ No third-party services needed  
‚úÖ Completely free forever  

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to **GitHub.com** ‚Üí Click your profile picture (top right) ‚Üí **Settings**
2. Scroll down and click **Developer settings** (bottom of left sidebar)
3. Click **Personal access tokens** ‚Üí **Tokens (classic)**
4. Click **Generate new token** ‚Üí **Generate new token (classic)**
5. Add a note: "The Shift Analytics Tracker"
6. Set expiration: **No expiration** (or choose your preference)
7. Select these permissions:
   - ‚úÖ **repo** (full repo access - check the top box)
8. Scroll down and click **Generate token**
9. **IMPORTANT:** Copy the token immediately (starts with `ghp_...`)  
   ‚ö†Ô∏è You won't be able to see it again!

## Step 2: Add Token to Your Config File

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Never commit your token to GitHub! We've set up a secure config file.

1. Open the file **`js/analytics-config.js`**
2. Find this line:
   ```javascript
   token: 'YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN',
   ```
3. Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN` with your actual token:
   ```javascript
   token: 'ghp_your_actual_token_here',
   ```
4. **Save the file** - This file is in `.gitignore` so it won't be pushed to GitHub

‚úÖ That's it! The token is now configured and secure.

## Step 3: Push to GitHub

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub analytics tracking"
git push
```

## Step 4: Test It!

1. **Visit your landing page** - Open `index.html` in your browser
2. **Click some buttons** - Try the "Register Now" button
3. **Check your GitHub repo** - Go to your repo and look in the `analytics/` folder
4. **You should see a new file** like `visits-2025-10-24.json`
5. **View your dashboard** - Open `analytics.html` in your browser

## Step 5: View Your Analytics

Simply open **`analytics.html`** in your browser to see:

üìä **Dashboard Features:**
- Total visits and unique visitors
- Button click tracking
- Traffic sources (where visitors came from)
- Page view statistics
- Recent activity log
- Beautiful charts and graphs

## What Gets Tracked

- ‚úÖ Every page visit (index.html, thank-you.html, upsell.html)
- ‚úÖ Button clicks ("Register Now", "Join", "Add to Calendar", etc.)
- ‚úÖ Traffic sources (where visitors came from)
- ‚úÖ Device info (screen size, language)
- ‚úÖ Timestamps for all events

## How It Works

1. When someone visits your page, `tracker.js` runs
2. It creates/updates a JSON file in the `analytics/` folder on GitHub
3. Each day gets its own file (e.g., `visits-2025-10-24.json`)
4. The dashboard reads all the JSON files and displays beautiful stats

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep Your Token Safe:**
- Don't share your token publicly
- If you accidentally expose it, delete it and create a new one

üìà **Data Storage:**
- Each day's data is stored in a separate JSON file
- Files are named like: `visits-YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- Data is stored in your GitHub repo (free forever!)

üîí **Privacy:**
- ‚úÖ Does NOT use cookies
- ‚úÖ Does NOT track personal information
- ‚úÖ Only tracks anonymous usage data
- ‚úÖ Data stored in YOUR private GitHub repo

## Troubleshooting

**If tracking doesn't work:**
1. Make sure you added your token to both files
2. Check that the `analytics/` folder exists in your GitHub repo
3. Make sure you pushed your changes to GitHub
4. Open browser console (F12) to see any errors

**If dashboard shows no data:**
1. Make sure you've visited your landing page first
2. Check that the `analytics/` folder has JSON files
3. Verify your token is correct in `analytics.html`
4. Wait a few seconds and refresh the dashboard

## Need Help?

If you run into issues, check:
- Browser console (F12) for error messages
